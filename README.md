# Real-Time-Kynetics-RTK
This repository contains Python functions to simulate Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) for precise position tracking. It includes functions to simulate position data, calculate distances, apply corrections, and check for significant position changes. Ideal for testing and extending RTK algorithms in GNSS systems.
